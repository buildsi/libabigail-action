# Examples

This directory contains a few simple examples. If you want an extended set of examples
not shown here, please [let us know](https://github.com/buildsi/libabigail-action/)!

 - [simple](simple.yaml): a simple c++ library build and comparing a release to pull request to main branch
 - [containers](containers.yaml): using a release and latest from containers, building the pull request also with a container, and then checking a matrix of libraries for all comparisons. This example was created for [dyninst](https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst)
